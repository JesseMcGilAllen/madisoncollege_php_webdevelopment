If you want to send me a message that is more personal than course related, like being sick and missing class, then send me an email at eknapp@tds.net. However, if you have a question about something related to the course then post a message on the "Yahoo! Group":http://groups.yahoo.com/group/php-mysql-s08/ 

h3. Online Office Hours

I use instant messaging to provide online office hours for my students. I use my Yahoo! Messenger account exclusively for chatting with students about course related issues. I am only online when I am available so if you see online just say hi and ask away. There is no reason to ask me if I could take a question, if I don't want to be interrupted I won't be online.
<br /><br />
If you would like to join the fun then get a chat app that does Yahoo! and chat with me. My account is *ejknapp1*. Just add me to your buddy list if you would like to be a part of this very efficient communication.  Here are some applications that work:

* Yahoo has their own app that runs on Win and Mac. I don't like it very much but it works.
* The open source application "pidgin":http://www.pidgin.im/ is very nice and would be my first choice on Win or Linux.
* For Max OS X the best is "Adium":http://www.adiumx.com/ which is what I use.
