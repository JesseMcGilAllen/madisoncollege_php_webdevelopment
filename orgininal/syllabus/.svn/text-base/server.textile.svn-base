h3. About our class server:

Each student will have an account on a Linux-based server. Use this to
store PHP files for in-class labs and projects. Student usernames on the
server will be first initial and last name. The instructor will tell you
the password at the first class period.
<br /><br />

h3. Sign-On instructions:

* To sign-on to the server, use ssh from your *Linux virtual machine (VM)*:
<br />
<pre>ssh djefferson@itins3.matcmadison.edu
</pre>
<br />
or
<br />
<pre>ssh djefferson@198.150.221.252
</pre>
* From a Windows PC you can use the *Putty* terminal emulator to connect to the class server.
* Only use YOUR first initial and last name. You will be prompted for a password. As soon as you login to the server change your password using the passwd command.
<br /><br />

h3. Copying Files:

* Use the secure copy command, scp, to copy the files to and from the server from your *Linux VM*. To copy to a directory on the server use:
<br />
<pre>scp filename djefferson@itins3.matcmadison.edu:/home/djefferson/
</pre>
<br />
or
<br />
<pre>scp filename djefferson@198.150.221.252:/home/djefferson/
</pre>
* To copy from a directory on the server to your current directory use:
<br /><pre>scp djefferson@itins3.matcmadison.edu:/home/djefferson/filename .
</pre>
<br />
or
<br />
<pre>scp djefferson@198.150.221.252:/home/djefferson/filename .
</pre>
* Note the period (.) at the end of the last two commands! It indicates that the file should be copied to the current directory and given the same name as the source file.
* On Windows you can download and install *WinSCP* to copy files to and from the class server.
