With a drivers' license, "authentication" means verifying that it is really you who owns the license by checking your picture and expiration date, and "authorization" means validating what type of vehicle you are authorized to drive, such as a car, a large truck, or a school bus.
</p><p>
Similarly, the primary purpose of the MySQL privilege system is to authenticate that the user and password are valid to connect to the specified host, as demonstrated in the previous examples in both the command-line and graphical client. The second purpose of the privilege system is to specify what the user, once connected to the database, is authorized to do. For example, some users might be authorized to only select and view the data from a specific database, but not make any changes to it. Some might be able to delete records, but not tables.
</p><p>
Once you have installed MySQL, it is time to understand some basic guidelines of how to administer a MySQL database server, such as setting up the users and the privileges they have on certain databases. You can use either the mysql command-line tool or the mysqladmin tool for performing administrative tasks. Although there are some graphical administrative tools avaialable, we use the command-line tools because they are always available and work the same way regardless of your operating system whether it is Windows, Macintosh, or Linux.
</p><p>
The next section assumes you have basic SQL skills, such as familiarity with INSERT/ UPDATE/ DELETE/ SELECT statements. If not, the SQL language is summarized in Chapter 14, "SQL Language Tutorial."
</p><p>
13.4.1. Logging into the Database Server
</p><p>
When MySQL is installed, the mysql database is created with tables, called grant tables that define the initial user accounts and privileges. The first account is that of a user named "root," also called the superuser. The superuser can do anything, meaning anyone logging onto the database as root is granted all privileges. Initially the root account has no password, making it easy for anyone to log on as the superuser. The other type of accounts created are anonymous user accounts, also without a password. For both the root and anonymous accounts, Windows gets one each and UNIX gets two. Either way, to avoid security problems, the first thing you should do, once the MySQL server starts, is to set a password on the root account and the anonymous accounts.
</p><p>
MySQL keeps track of its own users and passwords separate from the operating system where it is running. All the privileges for the MySQL database server are stored in the "mysql" database (the database with name "mysql").
</p><p>
For administration purposes, you should have root access rights to your server. The mysqladmin utility is useful for creating passwords as well as performing other MySQL administrative tasks. In the next example it is used to set the password for the root user.
</p><p>
When working with MySQL, a number of like-name terms are used. Table 13.2 is provided to help clarify the use of these terms.
</p><p>
Table 13.2. MySQL Terminology
</p><p>
Term	Description
mySQL	The actual software for the database management system
mysqld	The mySQL daemon or server process
mysql monitor	The monitor where MySQL commands are issued (command-line interpreter)
mysql	The name of the database MySQL uses to manage access privileges
mysqladmin	A MySQL utility program for administering the database
</p><p>
Example 13.2.

1  $ mysqladmin -u root -h localhost password quigley1

2  $ mysql -uroot -hlocalhost -pquigley1
   Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your MySQL connection id is 29 to server version:
   5.0.21-community-nt

  Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.


Explanation

1	The mysqladmin program is used to set the password for root user on the localhost. The password is quigley1.
2	This logs the root user into the database server. The -u switch is followed by the user or login name (no spaces between -u and the username). This user is logging in as root. Similarly, the -p switch is followed by the actual password, in this case quigley1. If a password is not provided, you will be prompted to enter one.
</p><p>
13.4.2. Finding the Databases
</p><p>
The database server keeps a list of available databases that can be displayed as a table by issuing the show command at the mysql prompt, as shown in Example 13.3. Typically when you install MySQL it comes with two databases: "test" and "mysql". The "test" database is used for testing various features or creating sample databases. You normally do not need to have any special permissions to be able to do anything in that database. The "mysql" database is a special database where the MySQL server stores various access permissions. We look at the contents of the "mysql" database in the next section.
</p><p>
Example 13.3.

C:\>mysql -uroot -ppassword
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5 to server version: 4.1.11-nt

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

Explanation

The show databases command gives us the list of all the databases on this server. Typically, when you install MySQL, you will be given the "mysql" database and the "test" database. The "test" database is just for testing purposes and is empty. The "mysql" database contains all the MySQL server privilege information.

Explanation

1	The use mysql command tells the server to switch to the "mysql" database and make that the current database.
2	The show tables command displays all the database tables in the current "mysql" database. This database contains 15 tables. The tables we are concerned with now are "host," "user," and "db."
</p><p>
13.4.3. The "user" Table
</p><p>
The "user" table specifies the users who are allowed to log into the database server and from what host. It also holds their passwords and global access privileges.
</p><p>
Let's look at the fields of the "user" table:
</p><p>

| Field                 |  Type                             |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Host                  | varchar(60)                       |

+-----------------------+-----------------------------------+
31 rows in set (0.00 sec)

					  

</p><p>
The key fields are Host, User, and Password. All the other fields are used to fine-tune the privileges. To log in, the user and password must match and the user must be from the given host.
</p><p>
The password field should be encoded so that it is not easily readable by someone looking over your shoulder. MySQL provides a function called password() to do just that. We see how to use it in the next example.
</p><p>
13.4.4. The "db" Table
</p><p>
The "db" table determines which databases a user is permitted to read, edit, and delete, limiting access to a certain host and user. Its contents are described in the following table:
</p><p>
mysql> describe db;
+-----------------------+---------------+
| Field                 |  Type         |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| Host                  | char(60)      |
| Db                    | char(64)      |
| User                  | char(16)      |
| Select_priv           | enum('N','Y') |
| Insert_priv           | enum('N','Y') |
| Update_priv           | enum('N','Y') |
| Delete_priv           | enum('N','Y') |
| Create_priv           | enum('N','Y') |
| Drop_priv             | enum('N','Y') |
| Grant_priv            | enum('N','Y') |
| References_priv       | enum('N','Y') |
| Index_priv            | enum('N','Y') |
| Alter_priv            | enum('N','Y') |
| Create_tmp_table_priv | enum('N','Y') |
| Lock_tables_priv      | enum('N','Y') |
+-----------------------+---------------+

</p><p>
The key fields are the Host, Db, and User fields. The other fields are used for fine-tuning the access rights. The default value is always "No" for the privileges, meaning that access rights must be explicitly granted. ('N' is no and 'Y' is yes.)
</p><p>
13.4.5. The "host" Table
</p><p>
The "host" table is an extension of the "db" table if the "db" table does not have a host entry. It contains the hosts (IP addresses), databases, and privileges that can connect to the MySQL database server. Typically, your PHP script is running on the same host computer as your database server. The host is called "localhost," which is simply an alias for the current host machine located at IP address 127.0.0.1. For example, if you are on the server myserver.com, you can refer to it to as the localhost. If later you change the name of the server to yourhost.com, your database connection will still be available because localhost always refers to the current host computer.
</p><p>
The fields in the "host" table are shown in the following table:

mysql> describe host;
+-----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field                 | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Host                  | char(60)      |      | PRI |         |       |
| Db                    | char(64)      |      | PRI |         |       |
| Select_priv           | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Insert_priv           | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Update_priv           | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Delete_priv           | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Create_priv           | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Drop_priv             | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Grant_priv            | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| References_priv       | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Index_priv            | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Alter_priv            | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Create_tmp_table_priv | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
| Lock_tables_priv      | enum('N','Y') |      |     | N       |       |
+-----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
14 rows in set (0.31 sec)

</p><p>
The Db field contains all the users, databases, and hostnames for this MySQL server. The other fields are switches with Yes/No options to grant or revoke certain privileges and specify the level of that access right.
</p><p>
Example 13.5.

mysql> insert into host (host, db, Select_priv, Insert_priv,
    ->        Update_priv, Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv)
    ->        values ('localhost',
'northwind','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.53 sec)


Explanation

The insert into host command grants Select/Insert/Update/Delete/Create/Drop access to the "northwind" database from the localhost, setting certain switches to Y for yes. The ones that are not set will default to no. See Figure 13.17 for actual command and output.
</p><p>

</p><p>
13.4.6. A Real-World Example
</p><p>
The following steps set privileges so that user bob can log into a MySQL database called "northwind" from the localhost using the password guess. After entering the mysql database with the use mysql command, the steps are:
</p><p>
1.
	
Create the host record:
</p><p>
mysql> insert into host(host, db, Select_priv, Insert_priv,
    ->        Update_priv, Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv)
    ->        values ('localhost',
'northwind','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');


2.
	
Create the user:
</p><p>
mysql> insert into user(host,user,password)
    ->        values('localhost','bob',password('guess'));


	
3.
	
Update the "db" table:
</p><p>
mysql> insert into db
(host,db,user,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,
    ->        Delete_priv,Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    ->        values
('localhost','northwind','bob','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');


4.
	
Flush privileges:
</p><p>
mysql> flush privileges;

</p><p>
Flushing privileges makes the latest changes active.

5.
	
Finally, to test whether everything is set up properly, you can log out of the mysql server and try to reconnect using the user bob, password guess, and host localhost to the database northwind:
</p><p>
C:\>mysql -ubob -pguess -hlocalhost northwind
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8 to server version: 4.1.11-nt
</p><p>
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

</p><p>
13.4.7. The Grant and Revoke Commands
</p><p>
MySQL access control involves two stages when you try to connect to the mysql server. First the server checks to see if you are allowed to connect, and second, if you can connect, the server checks each statement you issue to determine whether or not you have sufficient privileges to execute the command. For example, if you try to create or drop a table in the database, or try to update a record, the server verifies that you have the correct privileges to execute those commands. To simplify all the steps required to set up the privileges on a database or a table, MySQL provides two commands: GRANT and REVOKE.
</p><p>
The best way to illustrate how to use them is to see the following examples.
Example 13.6.

1  GRANT ALL ON *.*
2  REVOKE ALL ON *.*


Explanation

1	Grants all the privileges to all databases on the current server.
2	Revokes all the privileges to all databases on the current server.
</p><p>
Example 13.7.

1  GRANT ALL ON db_name.*
2  REVOKE ALL ON db_name.*


Explanation

1	Grants all the privileges to all the tables in the database db_name.
2	Revokes all the privileges to all the tables of the database identified by db_name.
</p><p>
Example 13.8.

1  GRANT ALL ON db_name.tbl_name
2  REVOKE ALL ON db_name.tbl_name


Explanation

1	Grants all the privileges to a specific table tbl_name in the database db_name.
2	Revokes the privileges of a table tbl_name in the database db_name.
</p><p>
You can also specify the user for which you are granting or revoking the privileges by adding the TO 'user'@'host' and IDENTIFIED BY 'password' statement.
</p><p>
Example 13.9.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_name.tbl_name TO 'bob'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'guess'


Explanation

This command will give user bob all the privileges when he logs in from the localhost and tries to access database db_name and table tbl_name.
</p><p>
13.4.8. Creating and Dropping a Database
</p><p>
Creating a database is simple. Designing it is another story and depends on your requirements and the model you will use to organize your data. With the smallest database, you will have to create at least one table. The next chapter discusses how to create and drop both databases and tables. Assuming you have been granted permission to create a database, you can do it at the mysql command line or with the mysqladmin tool as in Example 13.10.
</p><p>
Example 13.10.

2	Just because the database has been created does not mean you are in it. To enter the new database, the use command is executed.
3	The show command lists all the tables in the database.
4	To create a table, the table columns are defined with the data types for each column. In this table the two columns field1 and field2 are defined. The first field will be assigned integer values and the second field will be assigned up to 50 characters.
5	After creating the table, the show command displays the contents of the table.
6	The drop table command destroys a table test and its contents.
7	The drop database command destroys the my_sample_db database and its contents.
