h2. In-class Lab 5.2


h3. Exercise 1 - This Old Man script using basic arrays

# Create a directory named *lab05* under your labs directory, which is under your webserver's document root, if it does not already exist.
# Create a script named *lab5x2ex1.php* and save it into your *lab05* directory.
# Add 2 numerically indexed PHP array variables to hold the values that change in the verses of the "This Old Man" song:
** First array values are: "on my thumb", "on my shoe", "on my knee", "on a door"
** Second array values are: "one", "two", "three", "four"

4. Use a for loop and an echo statement to print the song. Your output should look like this:
<br /><pre>
This old man, He played one
He played knick-knack on my thumb
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played two
He played knick-knack on my shoe
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played three
He played knick-knack on my knee
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played four
He played knick-knack on a door
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home
</pre>

h3. Exercise 2 - This Old Man script using associative arrays

# Create a script named *lab5x2ex2.php* and save it into your *lab05* directory.
# This time use a single "associative" PHP array for which you specify both keys and values:
** The array contains: 
<br /><pre>
"one" => "on my thumb", "two" => "on my shoe",
"three" => "on my knee", "four" => "on a door"
</pre>
# Use a *foreach* loop and an *echo* statement to print the song. Your output should look like the Example 1 output.


Show your instructor the working *lab5x2ex1.php* and *lab5x2ex2.php* scripts and demonstrate them in a browser.
