h2. In-class Lab 2.2


h3. Exercise 1

 
# Download the following HTML form file:
** myform.html ("download":/attachment/unit02/myform.html.txt or "view":/attachment/unit02/myform-view.html)
** Save the file as myform.html in the labs directory under your document root directory.
# Open myform.html in a text editor and inspect it to determine what fields it contains.
# Open myform.html in a browser to see how it works.

h3.  Exercise 2

# Create a script named myscript.php and save it into your labs directory.
# Add PHP variables to hold the values of the fields from the HTML form.
# PHP uses the $_POST[ ] array to hold form field values after the form is posted.
# For example, if there is a form field called "name", your variable assignment statement will look like:
<br /><pre>
$name = $_POST['name'];
</pre>
# Add PHP code blocks embedded in HTML to print the descriptions and values of all fields entered in the myform.html HTML form.
# If a form field is empty, print a "no value submitted" message instead of the field value.
# Test your code and show it to your instructor.
