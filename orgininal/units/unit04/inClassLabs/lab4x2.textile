h3. Exercise 1 - String functions

# Create a directory named *lab04* under your labs directory, which is under your webserver's document root, if it does not already exist.
# Create a script named *lab4x2.php* and save it into your *lab04* directory.
# Create the following string variable (there are 4 spaces before mary):
<br /><pre>
$myString = '    mary jones lives in santa cruz, california at 22 ocean drive.';
</pre>
# Find the number of characters in *@$myString@* and display it in your script.
# Convert the string to all upper case and display the modified *@$myString@* variable.
# Now, convert the string back to all lower case and display it.
# Use the *@substr()@* function, with another string function to print "Santa Cruz, California".
# Modify *@$myString@* to trim the whitespace from the beginning of the string.
# Find the index position of the start of the word "California" in the string and display it in your script.
# Show your instructor the working *lab4x2.php* file and demonstrate it in a browser.
