In-class Lab 7


  i. Exercise 1 - Create a class in PHP 5

       1. Create a script named lab7ex1.inc and save it into your labs directory.
       2. Create a PHP class named UnitCounter with 2 member variables:

          # var $units = 0;
          # var $weightPerUnit = 1.0;

       3. Class UnitCounter also has 2 member functions:

          #
              // Add $n to the total number of units, default $n to 1
              function add($n = 1)
              {
                $this->units = $this->units + $n;
              }

              // Member function that calculates the total weight
              function totalWeight()
              {
                return $this->units * $this->weightPerUnit;
              }



 ii. Exercise 2 - Create and manipulate objects of the class UnitCounter

       1. Create a script named lab7ex2.php and save it into your labs directory.
       2. Use the require directive to include the file lab7ex1.inc .
       3. Create the objects $bottle and $books of class Unit Counter::

          # For $bottles:

              1. Set the units member variable to 24 directly
              2. Add 3 units using the member function add()
              3. Print out the number of units in $bottle

          # For $books:

              1. Set the units member variable to 10 directly
              2. Set the weightPerUnit to 1.5 directly
              3. Print out the result of the totalWeight member function for $books


          Show your instructor your code and output.
