1. Concepts

    This project is designed to get you familiar with Perl. You will install Perl and run some sample scripts. Then you will create some scripts of your own. You will learn these concepts:

        * Creating Perl scripts
        * Running Perl scripts
        * Scalar Data
        * Scalar Variables
        * Getting input from the user on the command line.
        * Printing output to the command line.


2. Readings

    To prepare for this project you should study or review the following:

          Learning Perl, 3nd Edition. Randal L. Schwartz & Tom Phoenix, O'Reilly
              o Chapter 1, Introductions
              o Chapter 2, Scalar Data

3. Project Overview

    This project will introduce the Perl programming language and its environment.


4. Exercises

    Exercise 1

        Write a Perl script that displays your name on the command line. You
        should use just one scalar variable to hold your entire name and then
        print that variable.

    Exercise 2

          Write a Perl script script that has 4 scalar variables:
              o Your first name.
              o Your middle initial. (The initial should not include a period.)
              o Your last name.
              o Your phone number.

          Your script will output these variables in two ways:
              o First, your script will print out each variable on its own line.
              o Then, print out the data on one line like this: "Joe D. Programmer, 555-1234"

          You must use the four variables and concatenate them together. You can
          not create a new variable that holds the entire output.

    Exercise 3

          Write a Perl script that asks the user for both length and width of a
          rectangle. Store this information in scalar variables.

          First your script should output a line of asterisks (*) that contain
          50 of them. You must use the String Repetition operator to create a
          scalar variable that holds the asterisks. You can NOT just type 50 of
          them! It should look like this:

          **************************************************

          The script should then output the length, the width, and the area of
          the rectangle on one line like this:

          "A rectangle of length 10 and width 20 has an area of 200."

          The total output will look like this:

**************************************************
A rectangle of length 10 and width 20 has an area of 200.
       


5. Submitting the project

    All of your Perl scripts for this project should be in one directory. Using
    a compression program like WinZip, zip this directory and its contents into
    a single file named "project1.zip". If you are using UNIX then you should
    tar and gzip your directory into and file named "project1.tar.gz". Put the
    string "107-196 Project Submission" in the subject of the email. This is
    extremely important, your submission will be filtered to the class directory
    in your instructor's email and you will get an automated reply. If you do
    not do this accurately you will run the risk of your project being lost and
    you will not receive notice that your instructor got it. You will then email
    this file to your instructor. In addition to this your instructor might
    grade your projects with you in the labs.
