h2. In-class Lab 6.1


h3. Exercise 1 - Write and call a function

# Create a directory named *lab06* under your labs directory, which is under your webserver's document root, if it does not already exist.
# Create a script named *lab6x1.php* and save it into your *lab06* directory.
# Create a function named *@back_to_ya()@* that is passed a single argument.
# The function *@back_to_ya()@* will concatenate the string "You sent me: " with the value that is passed to the function.
# The function will return the resulting string to the caller.
# Call the *@back_to_ya()@* function 3 times sending a different value to it each time. Place at least one of your calls to the function above the function definition in your script (just to prove this works).
# Print the string returned from your function each time you call it.
# Show your instructor the *lab6x1.php* script and demo it.
