h2. In-class Lab 9.1

<hr />

h3. Exercise 1

# Create a PHP script named *@lab9x1script.php@* and save it into your *lab09* directory.
# Use the *@file_exists()@* function to test for the existence of a file. If the file does not exist, display a message containing the file name, similar to the *openFile.php* example in class, and exit your script.
<br /><br /> *Note*: You will have the same issues with reading a file in PHP that we had in Lab 8.2 last time. The directory you read the file from and the file itself must be readable by user "nobody", "apache", or whatever user the web server runs as.
# Add PHP code to open the file for reading with *@fopen()@*.
# Add code to read the file one line at a time with the *@fgets()@* function until end-of-file is detected by the *@feof()@* function.
# Then close the file with the *@fclose()@* function.
# Test your code by first using a filename that does not exist. Then switch to the filename of a file you have created with 3-4 lines of text in it. Show your instructor that both versions of your code work.
