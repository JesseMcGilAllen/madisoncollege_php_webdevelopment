h2. Installing jEdit

---

h3. Step 1

Close jEdit if it is running.

<br />

---

h3. Step 2 

Search for all directories on your computer named ".jedit", the period is important:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/search.jpg/!
</div>

<br />

---

h3. Step 3 

Your search might result in 0, 1, 2, or even 3 different copies of the .jedit directory:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/results.jpg/!
</div>

<br />

---

h3. Step 4

If your search found some .jedit directories the *delete them all!*

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/delete.jpg/!
</div>

<br />

---

h3. Step 5

Now launch jEdit, because it can't find a .jedit directory it will think this is the very first time you have ever launched it and will show you this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/first_time.jpg/!
</div>

If you don't see this then you have not deleted all the copies of the .jedit directory.

<br />

---

h3. Step 6

Close the welcome window and you should see this. It is the default jEdit without any plugins:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/jedit_new.jpg/!
</div>

<br />

---

h3. Step 7

Now close jEdit. When you launched jEdit it will have created a .jedit directory where it wants it to be. The next step is to find where it put it. You can do another search like in Step 2 if you can't find it quickly. Remember where you found it and delete it one more time. 

Now access the CD that you purchased from the MITA club. In the jEdit directory is a file named *jedit_plugins.zip*. Unzip this file, it will result in a directory named *.jedit*. Move this directory to the spot where jEdit had created one.

<br />

h3. Step 8

Launch jEdit. If you see the following then you have installed it correctly:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  !/attachment/jEditInstall/jedit_done.jpg/!
</div>

<br />
