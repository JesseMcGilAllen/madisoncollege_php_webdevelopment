<li>
<p>Before starting the
installation, you first need to know what you want to use PHP for.
There are three main uses for PHP, as described in the "What does PHP
do?" section.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In this course we will focus
on server-side scripting, and for that we need three things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) PHP itself </p>
<p>2) a web server</p>
<p>3) a web browser </p>
</li><li>
<p>You probably already
have a web browser, and depending on your operating system setup, you
may also have a web server (e.g. Apache on Linux and Apple OSX; IIS on
Windows). You may also rent Web space at a company. This way, you don't
need to set up anything on your own, only write your PHP scripts,
upload them to the server you rent, and see the results in your browser.</p>
</li><li>
<p>While setting up the server
and PHP on your own, you have two choices
for the method of connecting PHP to the server. For many servers PHP
has a direct module interface (also called SAPI). These servers include
Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), Netscape and iPlanet
servers. Many other servers have support for ISAPI, the Microsoft
module interface. If PHP has no module support
for your web server, you can always use it as a CGI or FastCGI
processor. This means you set up your server to use the CGI executable
of PHP to process all PHP file requests on the server.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you are also interested in using PHP for command line scripting (e.g.
writing scripts to autogenerate images for you offline, or to process
text files based on some arguments you pass to them), you will
need the command line executable. For more information, connect to the
online PHP Manual at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php">
http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php</a>
and read the section about writing command line PHP applications. In
this case, you need no server and no browser.</p>
</li><li>
<p>With PHP you can also write desktop GUI applications using the PHP-GTK
extension. This is a completely different approach than writing web
pages, as you do not output any HTML, but manage windows and objects
within them. For more information about PHP-GTK, please visit the site
dedicated to this extension: <a href="http://gtk.php.net/">http://gtk.php.net/</a>
PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On Linux distributions such as Red Hat,
Fedora, SuSE and Ubuntu, you can choose to install PHP (along
with MySQL and Apache) when you initially install the operating system
and have a decent LAMP environment set up with no additional work.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I will not attempt to give
my own set of install instructions here. They would be outdated
literally days after I wrote them. The online PHP Manual
provides installation guides at: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php">
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php</a>
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
For lab and project work in this class we will use both the PHP/IIS installation on
the lab's Windows computers and a PHP/Apache installation on an Ubuntu Linux
virtual machine which you may run using VMWare Workstation on your lab computer.
</p></li>
<li><p>
To set up a development environment for PHP, MySQL and Apache on a Windows
PC at home, I recommend <b>XAMPP</b> . It is a single file download that
contains everything you need. There are several options for installing XAMPP,
including running it from an external hard drive. It can be downloaded from:
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a>
</p>
There are also versions of XAMPP for Linux and Apple OSX. XAMP works great for
developing and testing your PHP code, but should not be used for a production
environment.
