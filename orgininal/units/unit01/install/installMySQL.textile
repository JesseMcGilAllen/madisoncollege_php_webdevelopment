h2. Installing MySQL

---

* On Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Fedora and SuSE, you can choose to install MySQL (along with Apache and PHP) when you initially install the operating system (OS) and have a decent LAMP environment set up with no additional work.
* If MySQL was not installed along with your OS, you need to go to the download page of the MySQL web site, http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ and get a copy of the last stable release of the software. You will need to make two important decisions when selecting what to download:
## Choosing which version to install
## Choosing between binary and source distributions
* MySQL AB currently allows you to choose versions 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0 of the community edition of MySQL:
## MySQL Community Edition 5.0 and 5.1:
*** These are both stable versions of the software. MATC is currently using 5.0. Version 5.1 has a number of new features which we have not yet tried. Either version will work fine for this class.
## MySQL Community Edition 6.0:
*** This is a pre-release or alpha version of MySQL, and is for the truly adventuresome. If you want to be the first kid on your block to try all the great new features being developed (and you are NOT going to run a production web site on it) here you go!
* MySQL AB makes both source and binary distributions of the MySQL database server available for download on its web site:
## Binary distribution:
*** If a precompiled binary distribution of MySQL is available for your platform, MySQL AB recommends that you use it. They put a lot of time and effort into creating and testing binary distributions for many different platforms. In particular they they provide binary distributions in the form of Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) files for the most popular Linux distributuions, Red Hat and SuSE, compiled on several different CPUs. If you are installing MySQL on Windows, you MUST use a binary distribution unless you have the Microsoft C++ compiler available on your machine.
## Source distribution:
*** If a binary distribution does not exist for your platform, or your installation requires MySQL features not included in the precompiled binary distribution you will need to download and install a source distribution. Use a source distribution on Unix/Linux platforms if you want a newer version of MySQL than the one installed with the OS, and a binary version is not available.
* I will not attempt to give my own set of install instructions here. They would again, quickly become outdated. The online MySQL Reference Manual provides installation guides at: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Installing.html
