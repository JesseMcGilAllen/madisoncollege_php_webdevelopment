h3. What is PHP?

* The short answer:
** PHP (recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor") is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
* A longer answer:
** PHP is a simple, fast, portable scripting language well suited for development of database-enabled Web sites. It was developed in 1995 and is currently powering tens of millions of Web sites worldwide. According to a Netcraft survey, as of October 2005, 23,299,550 domains and 1,290,179 IP addresses endorse PHP. See: http://www.php.net/usage.php
* So, what does it do? PHP can be used in three primary ways: Server-side_scripting: PHP was originally designed to create dynamic web content, and it is still best suited for that task. To generate HTML, you need the PHP parser and a web server to send the documents. PHP has also become popular for generating XML documents, graphics, Flash animations, PDF files, and more.

h3. Command-line_scripting:

* PHP can run scripts from the command line, much like Perl, awk, or the Unix shell. You might use the command line scripts for system administration tasks, such as backup and log parsing

h3. Client-side_GUI_applications:

* Using PHP-GTK (http://gtk.php.net), you can write full-blown, cross-platform GUI applications in PHP. In this course we will concentrate on the first item, using PHP to develop dynamic web content.
* PHP runs on all major operating systems, from Unix variants including Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris, to such diverse platforms as Windows and Apple OSX. It can be used with all leading web servers including Apache, Microsoft IIS and the Netscape/iPlanet servers.
* PHP is flexible! In addition to HTML and text files, you can also generate PDF files, GIF, JPG and PNG images and Flash movies.
PHP supports all major databases including MySQL, Oracle, Sybase and ODBC compliant databases.
* PHP provides a library of PHP code to perform common tasks such as database abstraction and error handling. The PHP Extension and Application Repository (PEAR) is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. For more about PEAR, visit: http://pear.php.net
