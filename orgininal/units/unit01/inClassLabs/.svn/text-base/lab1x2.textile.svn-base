h2. In-class Lab 1.2


h3. Exercise 1 - Log in to MySQL and view some data

# Open a terminal window.
# Log in to the class MySQL server using ssh (Secure Socket Layer Shell) by issuing a command similar to the one below. Use the user name given to you by your instructor rather than the one used here.
<br /><pre>
ssh djefferson@itins3.matcmadison.edu
</pre>
# Enter your password when prompted. Your instructor will provide you with a password.
# If using Putty, you will be presented with a dialog box in which you must enter the name or IP address of the server (itins3.matcmadison.edu in this case). Then click Open and you will be prompted for your username and password.
# Use a command line similar to the following to log in to MySQL. Use the user name given to you by your instructor rather than the one used here.
<br /><pre>
mysql -u djefferson -p
</pre>
# Again you will be prompted for a password. Use the password provided by your instructor.
# Enter the following series of commands in MySQL, and answer the questions below:
<br /><pre>
USE winestore;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM region;
</pre>
# How many tables are there in the winestore database? 
# What is the name of region number 7?


h3. Exercise 2 - Create a table in your own database schema

# Create your database with this command. Skip this step for the class MySQL server:
<br /><pre>create database eknapp;</pre>
# Change to your personal database (called a schema in some DBMSs) by entering a command similar to the following. Your instructor will tell you the database name to use:
<br /><pre>
use djefferson;
</pre>
# Create a table named test using the following statement.
<br /><pre>
CREATE TABLE test (
  pk integer NOT NULL,
  val varchar(20) );
</pre>
# Insert a row into the table test by issuing this statement.
<br /><pre>
INSERT INTO test (pk, val)
  VALUES (1, 'one');
</pre>
# Insert two more rows into the table using the same syntax as above. Use any values you wish.
# Run the statement below and show your instructor the results.
<br /><pre>
SELECT * FROM test;
</pre>
# Enter the MySQL command:
<br /><pre>
exit;
</pre>
 to quit MySQL and the Linux command:
<br /><pre>
exit
</pre>
(no semi-colon) to sign off from the class server.
