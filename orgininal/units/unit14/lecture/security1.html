<li><p>
Security is a set of measures applied to a Web application to meet the security
requirements of the Web site. A site will never be 100 percent secure — there is
always a way in.
</p><p>
Just as there is always a thief who can break into bank vault, there is always
a hacker who can break into your site.
</p><p>
To be secure, you must define your security requirements and how much you are
willing to spend to meet them.
</p><p>
In defining the security requirements of your site, there are several issues
to consider: The security of your network, the operating system, the file system,
the Web server your Web applications are running on, and, finally, the Web
application itself and the database it is using.
</p><p>
Because the focus of this course is on PHP and MySQL, we discuss the security
of PHP scripts and the MySQL database as they relate to one another.
</p><p>
The security of the network, operating system, file system, and Web server depend
on specific vendors and are typically managed by your ISP or system administrator.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Network Security and SSL
</p><p>
Network security refers to securing the physical communication between the user
of a Web application and the application itself.
</p><p>
For example, you may go to a local Internet coffee shop while traveling and want
to pay your bills online, so you go to your bank's Web site and type in your
username and password.
</p><p>
This information is highly sensitive, yet it travels over public lines that
cannot be trusted.
</p><p>
Most Web applications solve this problem by using an inexpensive system called
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
</p><p>
SSL is an encryption system that automatically creates a secure channel between
the client's Web browser and Web server.
</p><p>
For example, when you go to your online banking site, you will be redirected to
a secure server shown in the address bar of your browser as an address starting
with https, the protocol for SSL.
</p><p>
The client and server do a hand-shake in which they generate a key to be used
for encryption. This key is good for only this one session and it is disposable.
</p><p>
Even if a hacker could break it, chances are it would take much longer than the
time needed to pay your bills and log out!
</p><p>
To prepare a Web server for accepting HTTPS connections, the administrator must
create a public key certificate for the Web server.
</p><p>
You will need to purchase an SSL certificate from a trusted party.
This certificate, usually good for one year at a time, certifies that you are
who you say you are.
</p><p>
There are a number of companies who sell SSL certificates, among them VeriSign,
Thawte, and GoDaddy.
</p><p>
Installing SSL is also dependent on the Web server you are using. Contact your
ISP or your system administrator for help with setting up SSL.
</p><p>
Once set up, there is nothing you need to change in your PHP/MySQL application.
You just want to ensure that all the links use the HTTPS protocol rather than
the HTTP protocol.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Operating System, Web Server, and File System Security
</p><p>
Even before a hacker attacks your PHP application, he or she might try to exploit
the weaknesses of your underlying infrastructure.
</p><p>
Web servers are a common target for the attackers. Commonly used servers are
Apache and Microsoft Internet Information Server.
</p><p>
These Web servers are available to everyone and security holes are constantly
being discovered and patched. Make sure you stay on top of security updates for
your Web server.
</p><p>
The same rule applies to the security of the operating system, regardless of
whether you are using Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.
</p><p>
Additionally, it is good practice to run the Web server under its own system user.
Then, even if someone breaks into your Web server, he or she cannot easily
exploit the rest of your operating system. Create a user specific to the Web server.
</p><p>
On UNIX and Linux systems, this is already done. The Apache user account is
commonly given a username of <b>apache</b>, <b>http</b> or <b>nobody</b> .
</p><p>
Make sure that this user has read/write access only to the file system
directories where your PHP files are stored and not to the directories where
you have system files (such as <b>/etc</b> on UNIX or <b>C:\Windows</b> on Windows).
</p><p>
Also, make sure this user does not have access to your database files.
</p><p>
The database server, MySQL, should also run under its own system username and
have access only to its own files.
</p><p>
By giving the Web server and the database server each their own system user
accounts, you are creating multiple levels of security.
</p><p>
If one level is breached, the damage is limited to that component, not spread
through the entire infrastructure.
