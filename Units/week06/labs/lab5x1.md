#In-class Lab 5.1


##Exercise 1 - Creating Arrays

* Create a directory named 'lab05' under your labs directory, which is under your webserver's document root, if it does not already exist.
* Create a script named 'lab5x1ex1.php' and save it into your 'lab05' directory.
* Create a basic, numerically indexed, array named ```$items``` by using the ```[ ]``` operator. The values of the array elements should be: "milk", "bread", "juice", "hamburger", "sausage"
* Use the ```print_r()``` function to display the contents of your ```$items``` array.
  * Note: Use ```<pre>``` tags so that ```print_r()``` displays each element of the array on its own line.
* Now create a basic array named ```$groceries``` by using the ```array()``` function. It should have the same keys and values as array ```$items```.
* Use the ```print_r()``` function to display the contents of your ```$groceries``` array.


##Exercise 2 - Associative Arrays

* Create a script named 'lab5x1ex2.php' and save it into your 'lab05' directory.
* Create an array variable named ```$properties``` using the ```array()``` function with these key/value pairs: "Color"/"Red", "Style"/"Coupe", "Engine"/"2 liter V6", "Seats"/"Cloth with Leather", "Wheels"/"Aluminum Alloy".
* Use the ```var_dump()``` function to display the contents of your ```$properties``` array. You will want to use ```<pre>``` tags to enclose the output of ```var_dump()```.
* Use the ```array_keys()``` function to create an array named ```$names``` from the keys of the ```$properties``` array. Then use```var_dump()``` to display the contents of your ```$names``` array.
* Use the ```array_values()``` function to create an array named ```$values``` from the values of the ```$properties``` array. Then use ```var_dump()```


* Show your instructor the working lab5x1ex1.php and lab5x1ex2.php scripts and demonstrate them in a browser.
