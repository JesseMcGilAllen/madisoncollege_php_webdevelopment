#In-class Lab 5.2


##Exercise 1 - This Old Man script using basic arrays

* Create a directory named 'lab05' under your labs directory, which is under your webserver's document root, if it does not already exist.
* Create a script named 'lab5x2.php' and save it into your 'lab05' directory.
* Add 2 numerically indexed PHP array variables to hold the values that change in the verses of the "This Old Man" song:
  * First array values are: "on my thumb", "on my shoe", "on my knee", "on a door"
  * Second array values are: "one", "two", "three", "four"
* Use a for loop and an echo statement to print the song. Your output should look like this:

```
This old man, He played one
He played knick-knack on my thumb
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played two
He played knick-knack on my shoe
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played three
He played knick-knack on my knee
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

This old man, He played four
He played knick-knack on a door
...with a knick, knack, paddy-whack
give a dog a bone
This old man came rolling home
```


* Show your instructor the working lab5x2.php and lab5x2ex2.php scripts and demonstrate them in a browser.
