---
##What is 'scaffolding'
* Generated by the ```scaffold``` command
* Generates code based on the attribute notation ```name:string```
* Creates model, view, controller, helper, route, migration and tests
* Has default basic code

---
##What is REST?
> Representational State Transfer 

* Simple set of Verbs that work on each Noun of an application.

--- 
##What is a 'resource'?
* Simply a controller 
* Scaffolding creates a 1 to 1 relationship to model
* Does not need to reflect a model 
* Defaults to REST actions

```
DemoApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
end
```
```
Prefix    Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
users     GET    /users(.:format)               users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)               users#create
new_user  GET    /users/new(.:format)           users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format)      users#edit
users     GET    /users/:id(.:format)           users#show
          PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)           users#destroy
```
^Maps to CRUD actions (index,show,new,create,edit,update,destroy)

---
##PUT vs PATCH
* PATCH is like PUT however PUT works on the full dataset where as PATCH only requires the delta.
* PATCH was defined in 1995 and adopted into Rails in version 4.0

#Active Record Relationships

---
##Active Record Relationships
* belongs_to
* has_many
* has_many_through

---
##Validations
* Rules to prevent invalid data from being saved
* Can be conditional
* Provides error messages back to the controller
* [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers)

---
##Rails Console
* Let's you try out code against 
* ```$ bundle exec rails console```
