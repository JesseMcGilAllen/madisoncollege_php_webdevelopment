##In-class Lab 4.1


##Exercise 1 - Fun with String Functions
* Create a directory named `lab04` under your labs directory, which is under workspace/www, if it does not already exist.
* Create 'lab4x1.html' and 'lab4x1.php' inside of your labs folder.
* To 'lab4x1.html' add a form that lets a user input a string (text field).
* Pick 5 string functions from table 6.18 in the book, create a check box for each function on your form.
* When the form is posted to 'lab4x1.php' display all of the functions that were checked and their result is printed to the user. You may need to lookup how to implement the function from the PHP API.
* Show your instructor the file(s) and how they work.
