##In-class Lab 4.1


##Exercise 1 - Fun with String Functions
* Create a directory named `lab04` under your labs directory, which is under workspace/wwwj, if it does not already exist.
* Create 'lab4x1.html' and 'lab4x2.php' inside of your labs folder.
* To 'stringfun.html' add a form that lets a user input a string (text field).
* Pick 10 string functions, create a check box for each function on your form.
* When the form is posted to 'stringfunprocess.php' display all of the functions that were checked and their result is printed to the user.
* Show your instructor the file(s) and how they work.
