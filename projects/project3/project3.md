#Project Three
##A blog

Total Points: 20
Due: 12/07/2015

##Problem
We need a blog to share our learnings and increase our marketability.  Create a 
blog system that allows you to write posts, set a title and date them.  Also
create a web interface to administer the blog. This administrative interface
should be password protected in some way.

###Constraints
* The blog should be styled, use something like bootstrap or a pre-built theme.
* It is not acceptable to use an already built blogging engine.

###Going beyond 
* To really push yourself find a javascript or CSS plugin that styles code examples
many of them will just require you to put in ```<pre>``` to start your code 
sample and ```</pre>``` to end it.
* Add a WYSIWYG editor to your admin interface for the blog entries.

###Notes

##Directions:
* Create a folder called ```project_3``` in your ```php_course_work``` folder 
* Create a branch called ```project_3``` in your repository 
* Code a solution to the problem, keeping all code in your ```project_3``` folder.
* Add and commit the files along your way. 
* Remember to push frequently to github as a backup.
```$ git push origin project_3```

##Grading Rubric 
These are elements in addition to the points 
* The database should store the blog entries.
* The page should have some styled elements.

##Submitting the project
* Go to the github ui for your respository, create a merge request for your 
```project_3``` branch and ```master``` then assign it to the instructor (johnsonch) 
* Then go to blackboard and submit your github username and the number of the 
merge request
