#Project Four
##Flickr Feed

Total Points: 20
Due: 12/21/2015

##Problem
Some services provide search features and give you a lot of control over the 
results you get back. All you have to do is construct the right kind of request.

Create a website that takes in a search string and displays photographs that 
match that search string. Use Flickr â€™s public photo feed at 
[https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) 
as your service.

###Constraints

and then shows the images
