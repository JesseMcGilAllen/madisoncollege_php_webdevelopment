##Mad libs

Total Points: 20
Due: 2/11/2015 at the start of class

##Problem
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. 
You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the 
story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.  Create a simple 
mad-lib webpage that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and 
injects those into a story that you create and outputs it below the input boxes
and saves the the inputs and generated story to the database. Then displays all
the completed stories below in order of newest to oldest.

##Example Output (use a different story)
```
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly

Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```

##Grading Rubric

* Everthing should be contained in one self posting page
