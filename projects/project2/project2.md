#Project Two
##BMI Calculator

Total Points: 20
Due: 11/16/2015

##Problem
You’ll often need to see if one value is within a certain range and alter the 
flow of a program as a result.  Create a program to calculate the Body Mass 
Index (BMI) for a person using their height in inches and weight in pounds. 
The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula:
```bmi = (weight / (height × height)) * 703```

If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal 
weight. If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or 
overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.

Example Output
```
Your BMI is 19.5.
You are in the correct weight range.
or
Your BMI is 32.5.
You are overweight. You should see your doctor.
```

for PHP math functions.

##Directions:
* Create a folder called ```project_2``` in your ```php_course_work``` folder 
* Create a branch called ```project_2``` in your repository 
* Code a solution to the problem, keeping all code in your ```project_2``` folder.
* Add and commit the files along your way. 
* Remember to push frequently to github as a backup.
```$ git push origin project_2```

##Grading Rubric 
These are elements in addition to the points outlined in the syllabus.
* The page should have some styled elements

##Submitting the project
* Go to the github ui for your respository, create a merge request for your
